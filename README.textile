h1. Django Greeking

This is a small library of template tags and other template-related utilities for use with "Django:http://www.djangoproject.com/. It contains a set of tools for printing filler text in your templates, a technique from the days of hot type known as greeking.

h3. What it does

Currently, four components are bundled into *greeking*:

* Template tags for generating lorem ipsum text already available in "django.contrib.webdesign":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/webdesign/#ref-contrib-webdesign.
* Template tags for printing snippets from Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky.
* Template tags for printing pangrams_ in a variety of languages. A pangram is a phrase that includes every letter of an alphabet. 
* Template tags for importing an object_list of filler comments for use in greeking "django.contrib.comments":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/.

h3. Credits

* Packaging structure, documentation and style shamelessly ripped from James Bennett of http://b-list.org. I hope he doesn't hate me.
* Pangrams are drawn from Markus Kuhn at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/quickbrown.txt
* Comments drawn from the work of giants of our time.
