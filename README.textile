It contains a set of tools for printing filler text in your "Django":http://www.djangoproject.com/ templates, a technique from the days of hot type known as greeking.

h3. What it does

Currently, five template tags are bundled into greeking. They can:

* Generate the lorem ipsum text already available in "django.contrib.webdesign":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/webdesign/#ref-contrib-webdesign.
* Generate filler images of kittens from "placekitten.com":http://www.placekitten.com
* Print snippets from Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky.
* Print pangrams in a variety of languages. A pangram is a phrase that includes every letter of an alphabet. 
* Import an object_list of filler comments for use in greeking "django.contrib.comments":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/.

h3. How to install

<pre><code>pip install greeking</code></pre>
